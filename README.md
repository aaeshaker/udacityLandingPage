# Landing Page Project

My Steps to achieve all requirements:

1) Add a class named "section" to each section and put it in an array named lpSections.
2) Create two variables each for section title and other for section link of each section.
3) Create <li> with child <a> and append them in the <ul> "navbar__list".
4) To add the class "your-active-class" to the section in your viewport, you should know "is a section in your viewport or not?!
5) So we add a function and uses getBoundingClientRect() method.
6) Then call this function in the scroll event to add or remove class while scrolling
